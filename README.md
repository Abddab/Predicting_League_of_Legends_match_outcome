# Attempt to predict the outcome of a League of Legends match
The goals of this project are to:
1. Understand which pieces of information (features) have the greatest impact on game results (feature importance) :dart:
2. Attempt to predict the outcome of a game using data pulled from Riot Games's API :dart:

Before we begin, what exactly is League of Legends? League of Legends (or LoL) is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other's Nexus. You can choose from over 140 different champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory ([League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/how-to-play/), n.d)

There's an insane amount of information generated in every single one of the hundreds of millions of games played every single month around the world. Thankfully, Riot Games (the game developer) gives us access to all this data through their **[API](https://developer.riotgames.com/)**.

### Ask
To ask relevant questions, one should first understand 
Before collecting the data, features we want to track should be clearly defined.
